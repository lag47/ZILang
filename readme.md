# zilang
zilang is an interpretted language implemented in Ocaml with native support solving basic congruences, as well as a few functional programming features such as anonymous functions.
## Why?
Mostly to learn how to work with lexers and parse generators . Also, I just finished a number theory class where this might have been somewhat helpful.
## Inspirations
All of my knowledge of implementing interpretted languages come from assignments from either [CS2112](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2112) or [CS3110](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110)
